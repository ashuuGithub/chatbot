
1. Environment Setup:
    You use load_dotenv() to load environment variables, such as the database connection details.

2. Database Initialization (init_database):
    This function connects to the MySQL database using the credentials from the environment variables.

3. SQL Chain Generation (get_sql_chain):
    This generates a chain of operations that takes in user queries and generates an SQL query using a predefined template and 
    the ChatGroq model for processing the natural language input.

4. Response Generation (get_response):
   This uses the SQL query generated in the previous step and executes it against the database, then generates a natural language 
   response by formatting both the SQL query and its result.

5. Streamlit Interface:
   The user inputs a question, which is added to the chat history. The assistant generates a response using the chain defined 
   above and appends it to the chat history.
